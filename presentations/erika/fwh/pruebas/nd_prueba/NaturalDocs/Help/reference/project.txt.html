It's where you tell Natural Docs which folders to scan, where to put the generated documentation, and some other settings like what the name of your project is.</p></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="source_code">Source Code</div><p>You tell Natural Docs which folder to scan for source code with this line:</p><pre>Source Folder: C:\My Project\Source</pre><p>When you run Natural Docs it will convert any absolute paths into ones relative to the project configuration folder.&nbsp; So if you keep your source code in C:\My Project\Source and make your project configuration folder C:\My Project\ND Config, the path will change to ..\Source.&nbsp; This lets Project.txt remain portable across machines and play nice with version control systems.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about typing relative paths though, just putting in absolute ones and letting Natural Docs convert it is fine.</p><p>You can have multiple source folders.&nbsp; If you do each one should get a name to distinguish them in the documentation.&nbsp; Natural Docs will make a guess as to what they should be, but you can set them manually for more control.</p><pre>Source Folder: C:\My Project\Module A\Source<br />   Name: Module A<br /><br />Source Folder: C:\My Project\Module B\Source<br />   Name: Module B</pre><p>If you have a lot of source folders, another option is to use a higher level folder and exclude the ones you don't want instead.</p><pre>Source Folder: C:\My Project<br /><br />Ignore Source Folder: C:\My Project\Notes<br />Ignore Source Folder: C:\My Project\Test Data</pre><div class="Heading">Character Encodings</div><p>Natural Docs expects source files to be encoded in Unicode by default.&nbsp; It will automatically detect and handle all forms of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.&nbsp; If you have something different you can add an Encoding line to Project.txt:</p><pre>Encoding: Windows-1252</pre><p>This sets the default encoding for all files to Windows 1252 (Western European).&nbsp; If it appears in the project information section it will be the default for all source folders.&nbsp; If you put it under a Source Folder heading it will be the default for just that folder.</p><p>You can also set the character encoding for just certain file extensions:</p><pre>Encoding: Macintosh *.mac</pre><p>This sets the encoding for all .mac files to Macintosh (Roman/Western European).&nbsp; Like before, if it appears in the project information it will apply to all source folders, but if it appears under a Source Folder heading it will only apply in that folder.</p><p>You can also set the character encoding for a folder, or file extensions within that folder:</p><pre>Encoding: iso-8859-1 C:\My Project\Source\Module1<br />Encoding: shift_jis  C:\My Project\Source\Module1\*.txt</pre><p>This sets the encoding for all files in the Module1 folder to ISO 8859-1, except for text files which are Shift JIS.&nbsp; These rules take precedence over any rules for parent folders, so all .mac files appearing in Module1 are also ISO 8859-1.&nbsp; You can only put Encoding lines that specify folders like this under Source Folder headings.</p><p>All operating systems may not support the same encodings.&nbsp; You can see which ones are available on yours by running Natural Docs with the <a href="command_line.html">--list-encodings command line option.</a>&nbsp; You can use either the name or the code page number in Project.txt.</p></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="generated_documentation">Generated Documentation</div><p>You tell Natural Docs where to put the generated documentation with this line:</p><pre>HTML Output Folder: C:\My Project\Documentation</pre></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="project_information">Project Information</div><p>You should always give your project a title in Project.txt.&nbsp; It's what appears in the header of the documentation, on its the front page, and in the HTML page titles.</p><pre>Title: My Project</pre><p>If you want you can also add a subtitle, which is a second, smaller line of text underneath the title, and copyright and timestamp information, which appear on the front page and in the footer.</p><pre>Subtitle: Version 1.0<br /><br />Copyright: Copyright (C) 2022 Me<br />Timestamp: Last updated month day, year</pre><p>Timestamp performs the following substitutions, so if you were to use &quot;Updated month day, year&quot; it would turn into &quot;Updated January 1st, 2022&quot;.&nbsp; If you used &quot;Generated mm-dd-yyyy&quot; it would turn into &quot;Generated 01-01-2022&quot;.</p><table class="SubstitutionTable"><tr><td class="SubstitutionName">m</td><td class="SubstitutionDescription">Single digit month, when possible.&nbsp;

So if you put (see MyImage.jpg) in C:\MyProject\Source\MyClass.cs, it will look for C:\MyProject\Source\MyImage.jpg.&nbsp; However, you can tell Natural Docs to search additional folders for images with this line:</p><pre>Image Folder: C:\My Project\Images</pre><p>Now it will also look for C:\MyProject\Images\MyImage.jpg.&nbsp; You can specify as many image folders as you want and it will search them all in order.</p></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="custom_home_pages">Custom Home Pages</div><p>You can define your own home page for the documentation by adding this line to Project.txt:</p><pre>Home Page: [file]</pre><p>It could reference a documented source file or a HTML file.&nbsp; It will replace this part of the home page.&nbsp; The project title, search box, and side menu will still be visible.</p><div class="ContentImageWrapper"><img src="images/home_page_area.png" width="899" height="583" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 899px" class="HomePageArea" /></div><div class="Heading">Using Source Files</div><p>Using a source file lets you write the content of the home page in Natural Docs' own syntax.&nbsp; This is useful if you want to be able to easily link to parts of your code.&nbsp; If you don't want to use an actual source file you can <a href="comments.html#text_files">create a documented text file</a> for this purpose.</p><p>The source file must appear in one of Natural Docs' <a href="#source_code">source folders</a>.&nbsp; You can't put it in the project configuration folder.</p><div class="Heading">Using HTML Files</div><p>Using a HTML file lets you do anything you want with this area.&nbsp; The HTML file can be located anywhere though it's recommended that you put it in your project configuration folder.</p><p>The file must be self-contained so any CSS or JavaScript it uses should be embedded in the HTML itself.&nbsp; If you need to include images, external CSS files, or external JavaScript files you should use an <a href="styles.html#advanced_styles">advanced style</a> containing a <a href="styles.html#custom_home_pages">custom home page</a> instead.</p><p>These strings can appear anywhere in the HTML and Natural Docs will replace them with the corresponding project information.&nbsp; This is useful if you want to include a timestamp that automatically updates.</p><ul><li><p><b>%NaturalDocs_Title%</b></p></li><li><p><b>%NaturalDocs_Subtitle%</b></p></li><li><p><b>%NaturalDocs_Copyright%</b></p></li><li><p><b>%NaturalDocs_Timestamp%</b></p></li></ul></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="vs._command_line">vs. Command Line</div><p>Some of the options in Project.txt can be specified on the <a href="command_line.html">command line</a> instead.&nbsp; This is partially for compatibility with Natural Docs 1.x, as Project.txt was introduced in 2.0.&nbsp; The command line is available for those that want it, but Project.txt is the recommended way of working.</p><p>Anything specified on the command line will override the settings in Project.txt.&nbsp; Not only that, some will be saved into Project.txt, overwriting any conflicting settings.&nbsp; This allows people who used Natural Docs 1.x to migrate easily, as it will generate a correct Project.txt for them if they run 2.0 with their old command line.&nbsp; It also allows people to continue to use the command line if they choose and only use Project.txt for secondary settings like the project title or the names of source folders.</p><p>Settings are handled in four groups: source, source filtering, images, and documentation.&nbsp; Specifing a setting for a group on the command line will override all the Project.txt settings for that group.&nbsp; This means if you use -i to specify a source folder, Natural Docs will view that as the full list of source folders and ignore any in Project.txt that aren't also on the command line.&nbsp; The same goes for the source filters if you use -xi or -xip and the generated documentation if you use -o.</p></div><div class="Topic"><div class="TTitle" id="syntax_reference">Syntax Reference</div><div class="Heading">Project Information</div><pre>Title: [text]</pre><p>The name of your project.&nbsp;
